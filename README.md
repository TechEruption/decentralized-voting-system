# 🗳️ Decentralized Voting System (DVS)

A **Blockchain-based Voting System** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project demonstrates how voting can be made **secure, transparent, and tamper-proof** using blockchain concepts.

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 **Blockchain-based storage** → Every vote is recorded in a block and cannot be altered.  
- 🟠🟢 **Real-time Vote Chart** → Visual representation of votes (Modi Ji in Orange, Mamta Di in Green).  
- 📜 **Voting Records Ledger** → Transparent display of all blocks (timestamp, vote, hash).  
- 📤 **Export Data** → Save blockchain records as a `.json` file.  
- 🎨 **Modern UI** → Gradient background inspired by the Indian flag 🇮🇳, with shadows, borders, and a polished layout.
